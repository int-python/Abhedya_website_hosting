                            Abhedya does not collect personally-identifying
                            information about you unless you voluntarily submit that
                            information to us through this site, by email, and it
                            can also be by other means. To illustrate, if you send
                            us an email inquiring about our products and services,
                            we may need to gather information from you with regards
                            to your name, mailing address, telephone number and/or
                            e-mail address in order to respond to your inquiries.
                            When you visit our website, we may automatically collect
                            certain non-identifying information about you, such as
                            the domain name that referred you to our site, the type
                            of browser or the computer operating system you are
                            using, and navigation information. We collect this
                            identifying information internally to help us analyze
                            the effectiveness and improve the usefulness of our
                            marketing efforts. Our site uses Internet Protocol (IP)
                            addresses. The IP address is the number assigned to your
                            computer by your ISP so that you can access the
                            Internet. Typically, the IP address is changed each time
                            you connect to the Internet (this is a “dynamic”
                            address). Please note, however, that if you have a
                            broadband connection, depending on your individual
                            circumstances, it is possible that your IP address,
                            which we collect, may contain information that can be
                            treated as a personal Identification. This is because
                            some broadband connections do not change your IP address
                            (this is a “static “) and may be associated with your
                            personal computer. We may use your IP address to report
                            aggregate information on use and to help improve our
                            website. Registration forms on our website require you
                            to provide accurate contact information, which helps us
                            deliver a high quality of service. By checking the box
                            on the registration form and submitting your data, you
                            indicate your consent to receive marketing emails from
                            us and the personal data that you provide (e.g. name,
                            email address, phone number), may be Used to send you
                            information about our company, products, and services,
